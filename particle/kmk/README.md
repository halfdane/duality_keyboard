Cirquitpython-based firmware for duality/particle

Using kmk, it's supporting the integrated touchpad (with automagic layer switching) as well as most of miryoku.

I wasn't *quite* able to get the timings for homerow mods and layer switches from the thumb keys to satisfaction.

There's no need to build it, just copy it over after installing cirquitpython on the device.
Or run `make` to copy over the necessary files from kmk as well.
