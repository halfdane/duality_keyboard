# The Duality Keyboard

Generated using ergogen:

![Switch plate looks like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/halfdane/duality_keyboard/main/duality.svg)

To generate this, run `make`. That'll generate a whole bunch of svg files in `generated_files/outlines`. 
They obviously need quite a bit of postprocessing before they can be sent to a lasercutter, so in `to_laser` you can find all the files I used to lasercut the veneer layers.
